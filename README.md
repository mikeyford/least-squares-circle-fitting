# least-squares-circle-fitting
Visual basic script for dynamically populating a least squares regression analysis in Excel. The spreadsheet fits a circle (outputting centre coordinates and a radius) for an unlimited amount of observations of angles outside of the circle. The intended use case is total station observations to a tower from points found via high precision GPS.
