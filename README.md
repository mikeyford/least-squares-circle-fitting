# least-squares-circle-fitting
Visual Basic script for dynamically populating and iterating solutions of a least squares regression analysis in Excel. 

The spreadsheet fits a circle (outputting centre coordinates and a radius) for an unlimited amount of observations of angles outside of the circle. The intended use case is large numbers of angle observations to a tower from points found via high precision GPS.
